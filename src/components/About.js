          I'm a product maker (... and full-stack developer) currently based in Arizona, USA. I'm passionate about building products that help people and make a difference in the world. I'm also a big fan of open-source softwareâ€”which is why almost everything I build is open source! 
          <br /><br />
          I also love educating others about technology and programming, which is why I'm a content creator and write blogs in my free time. I mainly write code in the <strong>T3 Stack</strong>.

          I sold my first venture, Epikhost, at an age of 16. And then went on to build and fail a lot of times. I also worked as a freelancer, creating and selling discord bots and landing pages. Then, I went on to work as an app developer for Commnete, a startup based in Mumbai, India.
          <br /><br />
          My second exit was Tweets.beauty, a tool to beautify tweets and other web content. I sold it to Hypefury in 2023, and I got an opportunity to work with them as a full-stack developer.
          <br /><br />
          I've won several hackathons as well, like Calhacks, by UC Berkeley, which was the biggest college hackathon of the time, and Sunhacks, by ASU.
